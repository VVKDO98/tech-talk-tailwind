# Install Tailwind with CDN

> Use the Play CDN to try Tailwind right in the browser without any build step. The Play CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is not the best choice for production. 

Put this line of code in your site's head tag :

```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

And start using Tailwind.
